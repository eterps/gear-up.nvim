Tiny configuration to get started with Neovim.

Goals:
- Tiny (less than 100 lines)
- Single-file
- Language server support (+completions)

This configuration targets Neovim release 0.8+ and the nightly.

This repo is meant to be used as a starting point for a user's own configuration; remove the things you don't use and add what you miss.
I suggest [this blog post by Heiker Curiel](https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/tools/build-your-first-lua-config-for-neovim/) for a general overview of configuring Neovim.

## Installation

- Backup your previous configuration
- Copy and paste the file `init.lua` into `$HOME/.config/nvim/init.lua`
- Start neovim
- Wait until packages have been downloaden and press `q`
- Restart neovim
